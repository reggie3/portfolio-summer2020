description: 'The react-native-webview-leaflet package leverages the Leaflet.js library and React to create a map component for React Native applications that does not rely on Google Maps.  Additionally, since Leaflet.js is a pure JavaScript component, developers can implement CSS animations on map markers for a more engaging user experience.'

Click below to see a demo of the component in action.
[![YouTube Demo Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/IurE-a9P3tY/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IurE-a9P3tY)
The video demonstrates the various types of maps that can be displayed, animated markers, marker and map click-ability, and map centering.  

__Quiz__: What do the three buttons at the bottom of the screen in the video above correlate to?  The answer is at the end of this post.

So far, react-native-webview-leaflet (RNWL) has been my favorite open source creation.  I built it because I wanted a React Native  map component that would let me animate markers.  This was a capability that the [react-native-maps](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps/issues) component did not have at the time I created RNWL.  

The Leaflet.js library, the React-Leaflet component, and the techniques I wrote about in my Medium blog post titled [Sharing Code Between React Web and React Native Applications](https://medium.com/react-native-training/sharing-code-between-react-web-and-react-native-applications-7f451af26378) provided the foundations for bulding this component.  The great thing about using Leaflet was that it provides a pure CSS, HTML, JavaScript solution.  This means that HTML elements like markers can be animated using standard CSS techniques.

The GitHub repo for the project can be found here:

__SPOILERS BELOW__:
The three buttons center the maps on three different theme parks / resorts:
- The castle is the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida
- The mug of bear is my home-park; Busch Gardens in Williamsburg, Virginia
- The crown represents Kings Dominion in Doswell, Virginia
